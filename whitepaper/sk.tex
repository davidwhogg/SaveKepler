\section{Executive summary}

Fundamentally, this \documentname\ advocates \emph{image modeling}%
  ---building a detailed model of the pixel sensitivities and point-spread function
  as a function of focal-plane position---%
  along with a model of the position and brightness of every star in the field.
This level of modeling has not happened with \Kepler\ up to now
  because the data have been made extremely precise with good pointing
  and aperture photometry.
In the two-wheel era, \Kepler\ will not maintain precise pointing.
This is a benefit as well as a curse:
It reduces the precision of naive aperture photometry,
  but it provides data diversity that permits inference
  of the sensitivity map and point-spread function
  that is not perfectly covariant with the morphology of the true scene.
We propose capitalizing on this to
  \textbf{develop a probabilistic generative model of the \Kepler\ pixels.}
We argue that this modeling will permit continuance of photometry at 10-ppm-level precision.
In \sectionname~\ref{sec:extant} we show that we can improve \Kepler\ photometric precision with a focal-plane model.
In \sectionname~\ref{sec:future} we show that the expected drift or jitter in positions in the two-weel era
  will \textsl{(a)}~help with constraining this kind of model,
  and \textsl{(b)}~be obviated (in terms of loss of precision) by such modeling.
These results are relevant to \emph{almost any} scientific goal for the repurposed mission,
  independent of our secondary recommendations.

\paragraph{secondary recommendation 1:}
Shorten exposure times and increase cadence.
Note value for TTVs and asteroseismology.

\paragraph{secondary recommendation 2:}
If we are right that current mission precision can be maintained in the two-wheel era,
  then it is our (admittedly debatable) view that the highest-impact scientific project for the \Kepler\ spacecraft
  remains in the area of exoplanet detection and characterization.
In particular, we advocate de-scoping the mission to focus on
  \textbf{finding Earth-like planets on year-ish orbits around Sun-like stars}.
This de-scope would involve
  \textsl{(a)}~reducing the \Kepler-field target list to increase the fraction of Sun-like stars
  (and reduce the total number of telemetered sources, compensating for the cost of higher cadence),
  \textsl{(b)}~removing from the target list stars that are known to be stochastically variable
  at a level that would render unlikely the discovery of an Earth-like planet
  (to further reduce number of telemetered sources),
  and \textsl{(c)}~continuing observations in the current \Kepler\ field
  (to extend the observations beyond four years).
That is, we specifically make the (radical) proposal to continue observations in the current \Kepler\ field,
  despite the stellar positional drift we expect for such observations.
As of writing, there is talk of increased pointing precision for fields with particular auspicious Sun angles.
If using such fields becomes a requirement of the repurposed mission,
  this would recommend against making year-ish orbit planets a high priority.
  (this isn't necessarily true! If \Kepler\ changes pointings every 20 days, returning to the same pointing once
  per year, it will still be well-positioned to observe transits of certain planets; i.e. planets that transit
  once per year. It will only find 1/~20 of them in each field, but will look at 20 fields per year, so the
  net number of 1AU planets observed will be conserved. Difficulty: 180 day planets will also be observed once/year,
  as will 90, 45, etc. Can be dealt with statistically, through transit durations, and/or with space-based follow up
  (ie JWST) -btm  Okay I agree with this; let's move this to whitepaper 2! -Hogg)

\section{Philosophy and motivation}

Image modeling will deliver many bits; we will get more science per
downloaded pixel than the naive predictions of degradation.

\Kepler\ data are taken in a mode that is
near-pessimal\footnote{Neologism ``pessimal'' is the antonym of
  ``optimal''.} for the determination or inference of calibration
parameters such as point-spread function, pixel-level or large-scale
sensitivity map, bias, dark, sky, or contributions from overlapping
sources.

\Kepler\ core goals remain outrageously interesting.

We know a lot about the prevalance of planets and the stars in which
we could possibly detect them; we should use this to reduce our data
volume.

TESS is coming; we can help with that.

Asteroseismology and transit timing variations both benefit from
shorter cadence.

\section{Modeling of extant \Kepler\ data}\label{sec:extant}

\section{Future data \vs\ extant data}\label{sec:future}

\section{Target selection}\label{sec:target}

\section{Spacecraft pointing}\label{sec:pointing}

\section{Aperture selection for telemetry}\label{sec:telemetry}

\section{Possible showstoppers}\label{sec:stop}

In principle any physical effect can be covered by the modeling
methods we propose.

Heterogeneity or time dependence in intrapixel sensitivity variations
could be very difficult to model.

Propose multipole expansion to begin to address this.
