This is a possible abstract for the arXiv submission:

Kepler's immense photometric precision to date was maintained through
satellite stability and precise pointing.  In this white paper, we
argue that image modeling--fitting the Kepler-downlinked raw pixel
data--can vastly improve the precision of Kepler in pointing-degraded
two-wheel mode.  We argue that a non-trivial modeling effort may
permit continuance of photometry at 10-ppm-level precision.  We
demonstrate some baby steps towards precise models in both data-driven
(flexible) and physics-driven (interpretably parameterized) modes.  We
demonstrate that the expected drift or jitter in positions in the
two-weel era will help with constraining calibration parameters.  In
particular, we show that we can infer the device flat-field at higher
than pixel resolution; that is, we can infer pixel-to-pixel variations
in intra-pixel sensitivity.  These results are relevant to almost any
scientific goal for the repurposed mission; image modeling ought to be
a part of any two-wheel repurpose for the satellite.  We make other
recommendations for Kepler operations, but fundamentally advocate that
the project stick with its core mission of finding and characterizing
Earth analogs. [abridged]
